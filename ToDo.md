# Drudge CLI - Next Steps Todo List

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

- [x] **2. Folder and file refactor** ‚úÖ **COMPLETED**
  - ‚úÖ Reorganized project structure into proper Python package with src/worklog/
  - ‚úÖ Split worklog.py into multiple modules with logical separation:
    - `models.py`: Data models (TaskEntry, PausedTask, WorkLogData)
    - `config.py`: Configuration management (WorkLogConfig)
    - `validators.py`: Centralized validation logic
    - `managers/`: Business logic (worklog.py, backup.py, daily_file.py)
    - `cli/`: Command-line interface (commands.py)
    - `utils/`: Utility functions (decorators.py)
  - ‚úÖ Implemented proper `__main__.py` and `__init__.py` structure
  - ‚úÖ All tests passing with new structure
  - ‚úÖ README updated with package architecture documentation
